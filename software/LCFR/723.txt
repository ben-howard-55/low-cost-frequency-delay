DONE: maintenance task
- triggered when the button is pressed
- runs a task which will toggle the maintenance state

DONE: frequency task
- triggered when new information is available from the frequency analyser
- gets data from a queue
- will run the calculations to find frequency and roc
- write the frequency info to a history state for the vga task
- will then check whether the system is stable or not, partially with threshold state
- if maintenance mode is not on and stability is different from global state
	it will update the global state and it will call the load manager

load manager task
- if the timer is active, reset the timer
- if the timer is not active:

- if we are not managing loads and the system is stable, do nothing
- if we are not managing loads and the system is unstable:
	- set managing loads to true
	- instantly shed a load
	- start the timer
- if we are managing loads and the system is stable
	- this means we were triggered by the callback
	- if there is a load which is blocked:
		- turn it on
		- start the timer
	- if there is not:
		- set load managing to false
		- done
- if we are managing loads and the system is unstable
	- this also means we were triggered by the callback
	- shed load if possible
	- start the timer

DONE: switch poll task
- triggered on a timer
- if we are managing loads:
	- check against the previous value and make sure that the change
		doesn't turn a load on
	- allow it if it does, otherwise don't
	- turn off the blocked load if we turn one off in this state and
		it is blocked
- if we are not:
	- allow any updates

keyboard task
- check the character
- if the character is an enter and there is content in the buffer, update
	the threshold state
- otherwise, if character is is number or first full stop add it to buffer

vga display task
- triggered on a timer
- reads info and displays it
	- frequency history
	- stability or not
	- threshold info
